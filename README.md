# cloud_assignment_12

This project demonstrates how to use GitHub Actions for automated code linting using Super-Linter.

## Features

- Continuous integration with GitHub Actions
- Super-Linter setup for code quality checks
- Branch protection using pull requests and peer review
- Collaboration with classmates for review and feedback

## Workflow

1. All development happens on the `dev` branch.
2. Code is submitted via pull requests for peer review.
3. Once approved, changes are merged into the `main` branch.
4. Super-Linter automatically runs checks on every commit or merge.

## Purpose

This project is part of a school assignment to learn about:

- Version control with GitHub
- Collaboration using branches and pull requests
- Code quality enforcement using linters

## Author

This project is maintained by Ranindi Gunasekera.
